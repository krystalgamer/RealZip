# RealZip
Tool used to create zip files.

What i've done until now?
- User can choose how he wants to compress the file ( flag -c [0-9] )
- User can choose to log or not the file ( flag -l )
- User can choose to continue or not when the program can't zip a file( flag -l )

Requirements:
Zlib - You'll need libz.a. I use the 1.2.5 version.
